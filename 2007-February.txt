Subject: [Dijon-devel] Goals
Message-ID: <6538c8c80702150104y229e7ad6k966fbf4a831ba060@mail.gmail.com>

I see the main goals of Dijon as being to :

- faciliate code sharing between desktop indexing systems

- provide toolkit neutral implementations of the Wasabi specs

Since J-F and I started this, and that both Recoll and Pinot's code bases are
GPL'ed C++, this is what we chose for the filters, but it may make sense to
opt for plain C and a different license for other bits and bobs.
